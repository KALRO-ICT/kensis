This section provides detailed guidance on the procedures, standards, and workflows used by the Kenya Soil Survey (KSS).  
Whether you are working with field data, laboratory analyses, or predictive soil mapping products, these documents will help you understand the methods behind the datasets.


## 1. Field Sampling Guidelines

Accurate, standardized field data are the foundation of high-quality soil information.  
Our sampling guidelines cover:

### Site Selection  
- Stratified sampling  
- Transects and grid-based approaches  
- Landscape and ecological stratification  
- Accessibility and safety considerations  

###  Field Procedures  
- Soil profile excavation and horizon identification  
- Auger observations  
- Recording of colour, texture, structure, roots, stoniness, mottles  
- Georeferencing with GPS/GNSS  
- Field photography and metadata standards  

### Sample Handling  
- Sample labeling conventions  
- Storage and preservation requirements  
- Chain-of-custody procedures  

A full **Field Sampling Manual** will be available for download here.



## 2. Laboratory Standards and Analytical Procedures

Laboratory analyses are performed using accredited and internationally recognized methods.

### Analytical Methods  
We follow national and international standards, including:  
- ISO methods for chemical and physical analysis  
- FAO and USDA soil testing procedures  
- Standard operating protocols (SOPs) for KSS laboratories  

### Parameters Typically Analysed  
- pH (water and KCl)  
- Organic carbon  
- Total nitrogen  
- Available phosphorus & potassium  
- Cation exchange capacity (CEC)  
- Particle size distribution (texture)  
- Micronutrients (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe)  
- Bulk density  

###  Quality Assurance  
- Calibration procedures  
- Use of blanks, standards, and duplicates  
- Data validation workflows  

A **Laboratory Standards & SOPs** document will be provided in this section.


## 3. Modelling Workflows for Soil Prediction

KSS uses digital soil mapping (DSM) approaches to transform point observations into continuous maps.

### Modelling Framework  
Workflows typically include:  
- Data preprocessing  
- Covariate assembly (satellite data, terrain models, climate layers, geology)  
- Model selection and tuning  
- Ensemble predictions  
- Regression-kriging or hybrid geostatistical approaches  

### Output Products  
- Soil property rasters  
- Soil class maps  
- Soil health indicator layers  
- Uncertainty maps  

### Validation and Accuracy Assessment  
We apply standard validation methods such as:  
- k-fold cross-validation  
- Independent test sets  
- RMSE, R², CCC, and bias statistics  
- Spatial cross-validation when appropriate  

### Reproducibility  
All modelling workflows include:  
- Metadata  
- Version control  
- Documentation of covariate sources and resolutions  
- Traceable modelling scripts (available upon request)

A full **Digital Soil Mapping Workflow Guide** will be included here.



## 4. Metadata and Data Standards

All datasets include standardized metadata that describe:
- Purpose of the dataset  
- Sampling methodology  
- Laboratory methods  
- Spatial resolution and coordinate system  
- Modelling methods  
- Accuracy and limitations  
- Citation guidelines  

Metadata follow conventions aligned with FAO, ISO 19115, and national data-sharing policies.
