::: {#hero-heading}
This soil information system is one of the offerings of the [Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO)](https://www.kalro.org). It provides access to authoritative, actionable and high-quality nation-wide soil data and information to support evidence-based decisions on sustainable land management and land use planning in Kenya. The soil data are systematically generated, collated, curated, standardized, catalogued and maintained by the Kenya Soil Survey (KSS) section within KALRO, which is recognized by the government of Kenya as providing the national reference centre for soils. We hope this platform will be a valuable resource for every stakeholder interested in Kenya’s soils.
