## History

The Kenya Soil Survey has a long and distinguished history in Kenya’s agricultural and environmental research landscape.

### **Early Beginnings (1970s)**
KSS was established in the early 1970s to meet the growing need for detailed soil information for agricultural planning and land development. Early work focused on reconnaissance and semi-detailed surveys across major agricultural regions.

### **Development of National Soil Maps**
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, KSS produced Kenya’s foundational soil maps and reports, many of which are still widely referenced. These included soil classification maps, land capability assessments, and agro-ecological studies.

### **Modernization and Digital Soil Mapping**
From the 2000s onward, KSS modernized its operations, integrating digital soil mapping, GIS, remote sensing, and advanced laboratory technologies.  
The digital era enabled the transition from traditional survey methods to modelling-based predictions and national-scale soil data products.

### **Integration into KALRO**
With the formation of the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), KSS became a core department supporting national research, policy, and innovation systems.

### **Current Role**
Today, KSS is recognized as the national authority on soil information—supporting agriculture, climate action, land restoration, food security, and environmental monitoring through science-driven soil data.

## Looking Ahead

KSS continues to innovate in:

- **Digital soil mapping and modelling**  
- **Soil health monitoring**  
- **Geospatial analysis and big data**  
- **Decision-support tools for farmers and planners**  
- **Open data and knowledge sharing**

By advancing soil science and technology, the Kenya Soil Survey remains committed to improving livelihoods and ensuring sustainable use of Kenya’s land and soil resources.
