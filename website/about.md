# About

**Kenya Soil Survey (KSS)** is the national reference centre and knowledge base of Kenya's soil resources. As a section within the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), KSS plays a central role in supporting sustainable land management, land use planning and environmental stewardship across Kenya.

## Strategic Objectives

- Conduct systematic surveys, mapping, and characterization of soil and land resources at national, regional, and local scales.
- Develop and maintain national soil databases and produce thematic maps for different clientele (researchers, policymakers, planners, and the public).
- Conduct land evaluation assessments and offer advice on land suitability for crop production
- Standardize procedures for collecting, analyzing and interpreting data on soil types
- Support land restoration, climate change adaptation, and environmental conservation programs through soil monitoring and reporting.
- Provide training in GIS, remote sensing, soil survey, digital soil mapping and land evaluation
- Strengthen partnerships with counties, universities, regional and international organizations

## History

Kenya Soil Survey has a long and distinguished history in Kenya's agricultural research landscape. It was established in the early 1970s to meet the growing need for detailed soil data and information for agricultural planning and land development. Early work focused on reconnaissance and semi-detailed surveys across major agricultural regions. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, KSS produced Kenya's foundational soil maps and reports, many of which are still widely referenced. From the 2000s onward, KSS modernized its operations, integrating digital soil mapping, GIS, remote sensing, and advanced laboratory technologies. The digital era enabled the transition from traditional survey methods to modelling-based predictions and national-scale soil data products. With the formation of the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organization (KALRO), KSS became a core section supporting national research, policy, and innovation systems. Today, KSS is recognized as the custodian of science-driven national soil data and information, supporting agriculture, climate action, land restoration, food security, and environmental monitoring.

Kenya Soil Survey continues to innovate in:

- Digital soil mapping and modelling
- Soil health monitoring
- Geospatial analysis and big data
- Open data and knowledge sharing

By advancing soil science and technology, Kenya Soil Survey remains committed to improving livelihoods and ensuring sustainable use of Kenya's land and soil resources.
