    "text": "The present soil survey is the eighth in series of “Reconnaissance Soil Surveys” with multipurpose land evaluation. The survey covers one toposheet (101) at scale 1:100,000. The survey area has a substantial variation in annual rainfall with a general increase of rainfall northward and eastward away from the area bordering Lake Victoria. The drier areas bordering Lake Victoria have only one rainy season viz:- March-May, whereas in the wetter areas, the rainfall distribution is bimodal viz:- March-May and August-December periods. The variation in rainfall to some extent reflects the land use pattern which varies from mainly grazing with crop cultivation in the low rainfall areas to mainly crop cultivation with grazing in the high rainfall areas.\nThe report shows that the general pattern of the soil resources is mainly determined by the physiographic position, the kind of bedrock (parent material) and climate. Most of the soils are strongly weathered and are generally acid in nature due to the leaching of the bases. They are dominantly low in calcium, potassium and organic matter and hence nitrogen."

This practical exercise was carried out between 2nd September and 15th November 1974, during which period the author was in Kenya. Prior to soil mapping, a preliminary study was made of the geology, geomorphology, hydrology, climate, population and road pattern of the survey area. An analysis of the aerial photographs (scale 1:25,000) was done and a photointerpretation map was made. At the same time, the base map (scale 1:100,000) for the reconnaissance soil survey was prepared. Two types of soil surveys were carried out, namely, a detailed soil survey (scale 1:2,500) of Kampi ya Mawe Agricultural Experimental Substation and a reconnaissance soil mapping (scale 1:100,000) of a part of Makueni area. All the survey work, data collection and initial compilation of the soil maps and land suitability classification maps were done in Kenya. The report was prepared in Wageningen after the fieldwork. Chapters 3 through 7 of this report give information about the reconnaissance survey, chapter. 8 is devoted to the detailed survey."
