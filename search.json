    "text": "The present soil survey is the eighth in series of “Reconnaissance Soil Surveys” with multipurpose land evaluation. The survey covers one toposheet (101) at scale 1:100,000. The survey area has a substantial variation in annual rainfall with a general increase of rainfall northward and eastward away from the area bordering Lake Victoria. The drier areas bordering Lake Victoria have only one rainy season viz:- March-May, whereas in the wetter areas, the rainfall distribution is bimodal viz:- March-May and August-December periods. The variation in rainfall to some extent reflects the land use pattern which varies from mainly grazing with crop cultivation in the low rainfall areas to mainly crop cultivation with grazing in the high rainfall areas.\nThe report shows that the general pattern of the soil resources is mainly determined by the physiographic position, the kind of bedrock (parent material) and climate. Most of the soils are strongly weathered and are generally acid in nature due to the leaching of the bases. They are dominantly low in calcium, potassium and organic matter and hence nitrogen."

It was established in the early 1970s to meet the growing need for detailed soil data and information for agricultural planning and land development. Early work focused on reconnaissance and semi-detailed surveys across major agricultural regions. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, KSS produced Kenya’s foundational soil maps and reports, many of which are still widely referenced. From the 2000s onward, KSS modernized its operations, integrating digital soil mapping, GIS, remote sensing, and advanced laboratory technologies. The digital era enabled the transition from traditional survey methods to modelling-based predictions and national-scale soil data products. With the formation of KALRO, KSS became a core section supporting national research, policy, and innovation systems. Today, KSS is recognized as the custodian of science-driven national soil data and information, supporting agriculture, climate action, land restoration, food security, and environmental monitoring.\nKenya Soil Survey continues to innovate in:\n\nDigital soil mapping and modelling\nSoil health monitoring\nGeospatial analysis and big data\nOpen data and knowledge sharing\n\nBy advancing soil science and technology, KSS remains committed to improving livelihoods and ensuring sustainable use of Kenya’s land and soil resources."

This practical exercise was carried out between 2nd September and 15th November 1974, during which period the author was in Kenya. Prior to soil mapping, a preliminary study was made of the geology, geomorphology, hydrology, climate, population and road pattern of the survey area. An analysis of the aerial photographs (scale 1:25,000) was done and a photointerpretation map was made. At the same time, the base map (scale 1:100,000) for the reconnaissance soil survey was prepared. Two types of soil surveys were carried out, namely, a detailed soil survey (scale 1:2,500) of Kampi ya Mawe Agricultural Experimental Substation and a reconnaissance soil mapping (scale 1:100,000) of a part of Makueni area.
